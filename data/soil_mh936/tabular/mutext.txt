yes

Do lines correctly separate map units in the soil landform? 
yes 

Is there a need to create new map units to delineate dissimilar soils? 
Possibly, man-made wet organic soils may exist in small areas. If so these will most likely be the Odesangel and Ngerungor. (Point MUs may be appropriate for these soils) 

Are dissimilar soils consistent with the map unit description? 
Yes, excavated taro pits can be constructed anywhere. 

Is the intensity of mapping suitable for the land use? 
yes

Does the series concept, as correlated, fit the map unit concept? 
yes

Knowledge of similar landscapes in other survey areas and limited onsite observations

remapping:  In digitizing soil lines were replicated as closely as possible to the published hard copy maps. Remapping might be needed; lines were probably drawn broadly and generally  
Or road checking line placement ________

Is there an exact join with surrounding surveys? 
Does not apply, a MLRA MU needs to be set up.

Is soil mapping consistently applied to landscapes across the major land resource area? 
Yes

Does the use of features and symbols reflect current definitions and use standards on the Feature and Symbol Legend for Soil Survey, NRCS-SOI-37A? 
Yes, but probably a lot more swamps symbols that can be identified with symbols or point MUs. Cultural spot symbols (Schools, Churches)  may no longer be accurate. 

Will this map unit require extensive revision (remapping)? 
No extensive revision but the original mapping was at 1:8000 and the lines seem to be drawn generally. Field checking should be done for a more accurate line placement.

This map unit covers 949 acres. The map unit was originally mapped as Urban land-Ngedebus complex in  Republic of Marshal Islands. The map unit is mapped in MLRA 196 Coral Atolls of Micronesia

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD description from Island of  Marshal Islands are the same as the OSD. However, both have different taxonomic classification (OSD classification: Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic Udipsamments; TUD Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic tropopsamments). The OSD classification was evaluated with the current version of Key of taxonomy and no updates are needed.

In the OSD, the current typical description and typical pedon for Ngedebus were set up in the Island of Palau, Republic of Palau according to the manuscript from 1982.  However, the TUD description and location from the new Palau Island manuscript, 2011, is not the same as the OSD.  The concepts, pedon description and the taxonomy classification for this series is totally different compared with the Ngedebus OSD. The OSD is an Entisol while the 2011 manuscript describes a Mollisol. At this time we are not going to make any changes to the taxonomy until we get additional pedon descriptions and lab data.

MLRA 196 - Urban land - Ngedebus complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes

Introduction

This map unit is formed in sandy marine deposits derived from coral sand.  This map unit consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 118 to 138 inches (3000 to 3500 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 75 to 81 degrees F (24 to 27 degrees C) .Elevation ranges from 0 to 10 feet (0 to 3 meters).

This map unit is composed of two major components which are Urban land and Ngedebus. The Urban land is a miscellaneous area.The Ngedebus, loamy sand component makes up 40 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This component is on generally on the lagoonside of atolls on islands. The parent material consists of sandy marine deposits derived from coral limestone. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat excessively drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4s.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 40 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. 


Geomorphic Description
Landscape: Islands
Landform:  Atolls (representative); beaches, beach terraces and coastal plains
 
Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 1439 acres. The map unit was originally mapped as Urban land-Ngedebus complex in Republic of  Marshal Islands. The map unit is mapped in MLRA 196 Coral Atolls of Micronesia.

Minor Components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit.

Plan 

The SDJR - MLRA 196 - Urban land-Ngedebus complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes , will create 1 new national mapunit symbol, 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for Urban land-Ngedebus complex from 2 different national mapunit symbols. The table below summarizes the map units and survey areas for the 2016 SDJR project.

Future Project

Minor Components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit. Therefore, we recommended to create a SDJR future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 196 and update the MLRA MU and DMU.

OSD Type Location
The current type location for Ngedebus series is set on Island of Palau, Republic of Palau. However, based on ArcMap evaluation this Series is located in the ocean. The current location needs to be reviewed and relocated.

OSD Typical Pedon 
The Ngedebus pedon description from the current OSD is the same of the TUD from Islands of Palau. The TUD descriptions came from the old Palau manuscript from 1982.  The current manuscript of Palau Island from 2011 have different the Pedon description and taxonomy classification for Ngedebus. Therefore, we support a future project to address those issues.

Major Component classification 
A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD from Island of Palau on 1983 is the same as the OSD. However, there is a new manuscript for Palau Island and the TUD is different to the OSD. Either TUD , from 1983 and 2011 have  different taxonomic classification (OSD classification: Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic Udipsamments; TUD 1983: Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic tropopsamments; TUD 2011 Sandy, Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic  Haprendolls). We are using the current soil Key of taxonomy to update the taxonomic classification. However, we are lack of documentation and data for this component. Therefore we support a future project to perform soil samples in order to collect additional profile descriptions and lab data that would help to address those issues.


Lab data 
There are 79 Pedons in NASIS for Ngedebus soil Series. However, there are lab data just for one of the 79 Pedons in NASIS. Also, the lab data is incomplete and does not support Ngedebus OSD Classification: Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic Udipsamment.

Climate data
There is a lack of Climate data (temperature and precipitation) for Pacific Basin. In order to get more climate data we need to contact /request data to different sources like federal, state agencies and university. No field work is needed to accomplish this project.

Land category
There is limited information available to calculate the land category on the pacific islands. We need to contact different source in order to get the information needed. No field work is needed to accomplish this project.

Ecological Site 
There is no Ecological Site information. Therefore we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, name and group across the MLRA 196."|"465586"|"2068379"
